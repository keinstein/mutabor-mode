MUTABOR is a tuning software that allows to perform real-time music with dynamic tunings. The tunings are described in a language that is based on musical descriptions of music.

The driving application was dynamic just intonation in the Tonnetz of just thirds and just fifths using the navigation sceme that has been described by Martin Vogel.
